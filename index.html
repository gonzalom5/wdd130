            <p>Santiago is the capital of Chile. Chile is divided in regions and Santiago belongs to the Metropolitan region. In the north it borders with the region of Valparaiso and in the south it borders with the region of General Bernardo O'higgins. About 7 million people live in the Metropolitan region which represents about 40% of the population of the country. Also, Santiago is within an hour's drive of both, the mountains to East and the Pacific Ocean to West.
