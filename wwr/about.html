                        <p>In the late 1980s, in the picturesque town of Riverside Valley, nestled between towering mountains and a meandering river, an idea was born. It was the brainchild of our founder, John Whitewater, who had a deep passion for adventure and a desire to share the thrill of the river with others. John, an avid outdoors enthusiast, had spent years exploring the rugged landscapes of the Riverside Valley. The pristine river, known for its white water rapids, was his favorite playground. On one fateful summer day, John gathered a group of friends and embarked on an exhilarating white water rafting adventure down the river. The adrenaline rush and the camaraderie that followed</p>

                        <p>marked the beginning of something special. Today, Splash White Water Rafting stands as a symbol of adventure and camaraderie in Riverside Valley. John's vision has not only provided countless memories but has also boosted the local economy and tourism. Our team of dedicated guides and staff continues to uphold John's founding principles: the love of the river, the spirit of adventure, and the joy of sharing this incredible experience with others. Join us for an unforgettable journey down the rivers that first inspired John Whitewater, and let Splash White Water Rafting create memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
